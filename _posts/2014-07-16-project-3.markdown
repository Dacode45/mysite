Phantom limb syndrome is an intriguing. It illustrates that are actions are mostly
simulated by the brain, and somatic senses merely test feedback. I am especially interested
in the dissociation symptom. There are cases of sane people with amputated arms claiming
to pick up a cup in front of them with their phantom arm. My project is to replicate
this phenomenon by having a person pick up a virtual cup with their physical arm.
The only difference is that the virtual cup will actually be picked up.

The project will have a person wearing an [Emotive EPOC](https://emotiv.com/) and
an [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/en-us/) control a virtual avatar in a
first person game built in Unity. The challenges to this problem are monumental.

1. Synching thought with the VR environment is essential.
2. Algorithms to translate thought to motion have not been created.
3. Patterns of thought differ from person to person and day to day.

More details about tackling this problem will0 be posted to a blog.
It involves Machine learning, Big Data, Cloud Computing, Computational Neuroscience,
VR, and Game Programming.
