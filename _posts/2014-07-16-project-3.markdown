Phantom limb syndrome is an intriguing. It illustrates that are actions are mostly
simulated by the brain, and somatic senses merely test feedback. I am especially interested
in the dissociation symptom. There are cases of sane people with amputated arms claiming
to pick up a cup in front of them with their phantom arm. My project is to replicate
this phenomenon by having a person pick up a virtual cup with their physical arm.
The only difference is that the virtual cup will actually be picked up.

The project will have a person wearing an [Emotive EPOC]https://emotiv.com/ and
an [Oculus Rift]https://www.oculus.com/en-us/ control a virtual avatar in a
first person game built in Unity. The challenges to this problem are monumental.

1 Synching thought with the VR environment is essential.
2 Algorithms to translate thought to motion have not been created.
3 Patterns of thought differ from person to person and day to day.

More details about tackling this problem will0 be posted to a blog.
It involves Machine learning, Big Data, Cloud Computing, Computational Neuroscience,
VR, and Game Programming.
