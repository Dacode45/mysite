[Animoo Reviews](http://animooreviews.com) will be a blog for my friends and I to write
articles about media. Based on sites like Kotaku, Cracked, and the Times,
Animoo Reviews will feature an nearly endless stream of content to keep you entertained.
Look forward to the release on February 27.

The site is statically generated with Hugo for quick loading times and hosted on github.com
